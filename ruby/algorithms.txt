Brushing teeth

Pick up the tooth brush from the tooth brush holder. 
Place toothpaste on the tooth brush. 
Lift tooth brush to your teeth. 
Brush each tooth with tooth brush using soft circular motions. 
When you reach the last tooth, take the toothbrush out & spit out anything remaining in your mouth. 
Turn the sink on, take some water in your cupped right hand, place the water into your mouth and gargle and spit out. 
Place the tooth brush back in the tooth brush holder. 
Place the cap on the tooth paste.
