# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
 
 A tool that gives you the ability to fully engage with your code by allowing you to track progress, recognize changes, and go back to earlier versions of code/create a backup. 

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A git branch is a divergence off the original files or folders. You would use it to make changes from the master code while still keeping a clean copy of the master. Later, you can merge different branches off the code back into the master. 

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is a save point for the project. A good commit message is detailed enough to describe the update from the last save. 

* What is a merge conflict?

When there is contradictory code for the same project in different branches that you try to merge back together with the master branch (ex. if one branch deletes code while the other modifies it).
